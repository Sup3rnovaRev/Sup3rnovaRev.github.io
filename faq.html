				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Q:</b> Can I use my Steam copy of Modern Warfare 2 to play IW4x?</li>
					<li><b>A:</b> You certainly can, a steam copy of MW2 is the prefered way to play IW4x. Read the <a href="installGuide.html">Install Guide</a> to learn how to use your steam copy.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Q:</b> On IW4x can I play with players on steam or steam players play with me?</li>
					<li><b>A:</b> IW4x is entirely seperate from Steam MW2 server wise, so it is not possible to play with people playing on the steam version of MW2. You can however invite your steam MW2 friends to install IW4x, then you'll be able to play together.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Q:</b> How do I play with bots?</li>
					<li><b>A:</b> Using the console you can spawn test clients, these are stupid bots that don't have any AI so don't move. The command to spawn these test clients is <b>/spawnbots 17</b> (The number is the amount you wish to spawn). The alternative is to use a bot mod such as <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/bot-warfare">bot-warfare</a>, this will give the bots pathing and AI making them perfect for an offline match.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Q:</b> How do I install mods?</li>
					<li><b>A:</b> Please follow our guide: <a href="modGuide.html">Mod Guide</a></li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Q:</b> Will IW4x get me VAC banned?</li>
					<li><b>A:</b> The short answer is no. IW4x is completely external to Steam and Steam Servers (you don't play with steam users), it's impossible to get banned. IW4x players only play with fellow IW4x players as the servers are completely seperate from Steam. So be assured that you are at no risk of recieving a VAC ban due to the fact that it's very much seperate from Steam MW2 and VAC itself as it doesn't even run.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Q:</b> Is IW4x full of cheaters?</li>
					<li><b>A:</b> Absolutely Not! In-fact iw4x has far less cheaters than Steam Servers due to it's more advanced anti-cheat system, preventing .dll and process hooking exploits that plague steam servers such as aimbot and wallhack. Futhermore server owners have full moderation controll unlike steam as explained below so even if abusers do slip through the net they can be quickly banned.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Q:</b> Does my Steam rank and stats carry over to IW4x?</li>
					<li><b>A:</b> Nope, when you start iw4x you will be starting fresh as stated above iw4x is external from Steam. So you will have a separate rank, classes, title etc. When and if you go back to steam mw2 you will still have the same rank you had before in steam, iw4x does not alter this at all. However you can always manually set your rank back to the level you were if you wish as this is allowed, or just use the unlock all button in the barracks menu to get 10th prestige level 70 everything unlocked.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Q:</b> How do I change my sensitivity?</li>
					<li><b>A:</b> You can change your sensitivty either though the options menu ingame or for more precise values use the command <b>/sensitivty 1</b> (Replace the number with your desired sensitivty).</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Q:</b> How can I change my Field of View (FOV)?</li>
					<li><b>A:</b> Using the in game menu or using the console command <b>/cg_fov 90</b> (Replace the number with your desired FOV)</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Q:</b> How can I use cheat protected commands in private match such as noclip?</li>
					<li><b>A:</b> You must use the devmap command to load a map, this enables the use of cheat protected commands as it toggles <b>sv_cheats</b> to 1. Example <b>/devmap mp_highrise</b>. For more information on console commands see our guide: <a href="consoleCommandsGuide.html">Console Commands Guide</a></li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Q:</b> How can I improve my FPS?</li>
					<li><b>A:</b> The best way is to go into the graphic options of the game and lower all the settings. The next step you can take is to lower your games resolution, keep lowering it until you reach your desired FPS. If still your FPS is low there's a good chance your pc isn't good enough to play games.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Q:</b> Why is my gaming laptop getting low FPS?</li>
					<li><b>A:</b> By default many gaming laptops use intergrated CPU graphics to reserve battery, it may be the case that you need to force IW4x to use your dedicated graphics card. <a href="https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/72567/can-i-force-steam-to-use-my-nvidia-gpu-instead-of-the-integrated-intel-card">See this stackexchange post to learn how to force dedicated graphics.</a></li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Q:</b> How can I report cheaters?</li>
					<li><b>A:</b> Iw4x has no global control over server owners or what rules they enforce / who they choose to ban. For this reason if you encounter a cheater you must report them to the server owner you encountered the cheater on. Most good server provide contact information such as a discord. Note: If a server has poor moderation and doesn't ban cheaters it's advised you don't play on their servers.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Q:</b> Where can I download mods?</li>
					<li><b>A:</b> There is no one central location to download mods, so for this reason google is your best bet at locating mods.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Q:</b> What is security level and why am I stuck on it?</li>
					<li><b>A:</b> Security level is a built in security mechanism that generates you a unique ID, It's computationally intense so may take a while to complete so please be patient. If you wish to read more about security levels see the section in the <a href="supportCenter.html">Support Center</a></li>			
					<br>
					<li><b>Q:</b> What port does MW2 multiplayer run on by default?</li>
					<li><b>A:</b> The default port is 28960, this port needs to be forwarded on the correct protocols if you wish to play private matches with friends. 28960 on the protocols (UDP & TCP) need to be forarded.</a></li>			
					<br>
					<li><b>Q:</b> What port does MW2 singleplayer run on by default?</li>
					<li><b>A:</b> The default port is 28961, this port needs to be forwarded on the correct protocols if you wish to host a spec ops lobby with a friend. 28961 on the protocols (UDP & TCP) need to be forarded.</a></li>
